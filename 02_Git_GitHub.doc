What is GIT and GitHub?

Git:-
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer
 files. It was originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the 
 Linux operating system kernel. Git is used to collaborate on code and helps you keep
track of code changes. It is used by a staggering number of software projects, 
including commercial projects as well as open source. It short we can say that git is 
the engine which provies us with environment to perform version control. 

GitHub:
Github is the website which helps us to store our files online which the help of 
command or GUI provided by Git. In short we can say that 
git is the engine and Git hub is the body. Since both the name git and github are 
identical, so people often confuse between them and thinks github to be a part of git.
But as such github there are lot many website which provides us the online storing facility.


How Git came into existance?

The story of Git’s creation is closely tied to the development of the Linux kernel,
an open-source project led by Linus Torvalds. In the early 2000s, the Linux kernel 
project completely relied on a proprietary version control system(VCS) called BitKeeper.
BitKeeper was a distributed version control system that suited the needs of the kernel’s 
distributed development model.

However, in 2005, a licensing dispute between the Linux kernel community and BitKeeper’s 
owner led to the withdrawal of the tool’s free version. This left the Linux kernel project
in urgent need of a new version control system. Linus Torvalds decided to create a new 
system from scratch
